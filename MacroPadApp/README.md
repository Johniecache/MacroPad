# Macro Pad Application
This is where all the source files for the Macro Pad Application are neatly organized between gui, logic, resources, and testing files.

### gui
This stores all of the functionality of the gui. This could be considered the presentation architecture of a 3 layered design.

### logic
This stores all of the logical analysis or "under the hood" files that alot of the processing gets done in. 

### resources
This folder stores all of the files for saves and what not. I put mine in there as an example of how it should look.
